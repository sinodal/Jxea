# Jxea, the autonomous assistant!


Jxea is a autonomous assistant built on the foundations of Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud,
Raspberry Pi, and CodeMiko. What makes Jxea seperate from the other projects is that she has 
a temporary memory for non-essential neural learning - a memory of 30 seconds before it is completely erased and 
has to be relearned. Functions like learning the motivations and emotions of the outside world 
are not retained. Like Alexa or Siri, a name and preferences won't be remembered unless it is coded into JXEA. 
Basic motor functions and essential commands, such as tasks of learning new languages and 
fetching from the Internet, are hardcoded and cannot be lost. While she may not be the first, she 
is among the first virtual assistants to have an own face to be associated with. 

So rest easy that Jxea won't become the Terminator overnight and begin a desire to hunt down the next John Connor :)

Jxea is retained in a computer program and physical manifestation will begin when sufficent time and financial
assets are secured.

## Development and Donations log!
Development on JXEA began on April 9, 2019 on a simple Blender render for a character animation. From there, 
it turned into the first steps in turning JXEA into what it is today:

On April 9, 2020: Jxea was the main character for a then active animation project
under the name 'Project Sakura'. When production for the animation was discontinued due to business disagreements, 
Jxea and the rest of the constructed lands and characters were converted to other uses. 

On November 16, 2020: Jxea was turned into a live motion capture character using Blender, Unity Engine, and the 
iPhone X. This was the first log of neural learning for Jxea with assistance from an outside source. At this time,
a replica of CodeMiko was made only for internal use due to CPU consumption issues. 

On February 10, 2021: The first actual neural learning for Jxea began with the blueprints and physical parts of a
scrapped Amazon Alexa. At this point, Raspberry Pi was also introduced to serve as the 'brain' and talking point to 
the user. 

Donations are greatly welcome to continue the progess in turning Jxea into a physical asset and continue 
her neural training to autonomy!
